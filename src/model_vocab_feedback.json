Now placing your hand on your throat, create the puff of air while vibrating your vocal cords (you should feel this on your throat) to create 'd'. Next: day shhh as if you trying to make some quiet. While saying shh, place you hand on your throat and try to hum at the same time to make your vocal cords vibrate to create the 'j' sound. Putting the two together produces 'dge' as in 'judge'.",
