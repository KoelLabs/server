### Q/A checklist

- [ ] If you added new dependencies, did you update the requirements.txt file? `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- [ ] For new dependencies, also make sure to run `python scripts/license-report.py` to check for incompatible licenses and update the `Third-Party Software` section in [ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md](../ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md).
- [ ] Run formatting, linting, tests, and security checks `. scripts/alltests.sh` 
- [ ] Do a self code review of the changes - Read the diff at least twice.
- [ ] I have written tests for any new features and regression tests for any bug fixes.
- [ ] If you changed/updated/added ML models, did you update `scripts/Dockerfile.prod` to cache the weights?
 
### Legal Boilerplate

Look, I get it. The entity doing business as "Koel Labs" needs some rights from me in order to utilize my contributions in this PR. So here's the deal: I retain all rights, title and interest in and to my contributions, and by keeping this boilerplate intact I confirm that Koel Labs can use, modify, copy, and redistribute my contributions, under its choice of terms.
